# INST414 Capstone Project: Customer Churn Prediction

**Author:** Alexa Chu  
**Course:** INST414 – Applied Data Science Pipeline (ADSP)  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave and uncover the key factors influencing churn. Insights from this analysis can help businesses implement targeted retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce revenue loss.

## Dataset
- **Primary:** IBM Telco Customer Churn ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)), 7,043 records, 21 attributes  
- **Backup:** Bank Customer Churn ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com)), 10,000 records, 12 attributes  

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns  
2. Feature selection to determine key drivers of churn  
3. Predictive modeling to estimate churn probability  
4. Evaluation using predictive accuracy and actionable insights  
5. Documentation of limitations and contingency plans  

## Project Goals
- Predict customer churn with reasonable accuracy  
- Identify the most influential factors driving churn  
- Provide actionable business recommendations  

## Sprint 2 Progress

- Acquired and cleaned the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (7,032 rows x 21 columns after cleaning)
- Handled missing values and standardized categorical variables
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and identified key predictors of churn
- Refined problem statement to focus on short-tenure, month-to-month contract customers
- Prepared plan for predictive modeling, starting with logistic regression
